#backbone.btapp.js
backbone.btapp.js is an extension built on Backbone.js that keeps an up-to-date representation of your uTorrent client's state/torrents/etc. It runs in your browser and can connect to an arbitrary number of clients on your local machine, or remotely through uTorrent/BitTorrent's remote feature.

Also consider using [plugin.btapp.js](https://github.com/pwmckenna/plugin "plugin") which provides install paths for browser plugins as necessary in order to get a utorrent client running that your web app can interact with.
